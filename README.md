### Retrieving a copy of the "depository"

- `git clone https://github.com/munchou/OpenClassroms-Project-10.git`

or download the ZIP file and extract it in a chosen folder.

### Creating and activating the virtual environment
(Python must have been installed)
- `cd OpenClassroms-Project-10` (or any folder where the project is located)
- `python -m venv ENV` where ENV is the name of the folder where the environment will be created.
- Activation : `env/Scripts/activate`
    
### Installing the needed modules

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Starting the program
You must be located in the folder where "manage.py" is in order to start the local server.
If need, make the necessary migrations with `python manage.py migrate`
Then connec to the server:
- `python manage.py runserver`

### Getting to the application
In any browser, type either addresses:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or http://localhost:8000/
They both allow to access the API.

### Connecting to an account
There are by default 3 available users (and the admin).

|       *ID*        |   *Password*   |
|-------------------|----------------|
| User2             |    user4321    |
| User3             |    user4321    |
| User4             |    user4321    |
| admin             |      admin     |
